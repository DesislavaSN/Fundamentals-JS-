// A function that collects each element of an array, on a given step.
// The collections are every element on the N-th step starting from the first one. 
// If the step is "3", you need to print the 1-st, the 4-th, the 7-th â€¦ and so on, until you reach the end of the array. 
// Then, print elements in a row, separated by a single space.
