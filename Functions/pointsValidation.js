// A function that receives two points in the format [x1, y1, x2, y2] and checks if the distances between each point (x, y) and 
// the start of the Cartesian coordinate system (0, 0) and between the points themselves is valid. 
// A distance between two points is considered valid if it is an integer value.
// The order of comparisons should always be first {x1, y1} to {0, 0}, then {x2, y2} to {0, 0} and finally {x1, y1} to {x2, y2}. 
// The distance formula for the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is as follows: d=âˆš[(x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2]
